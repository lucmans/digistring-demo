This repository contains demo files for [Digistring](https://github.com/lucmans/digistring).

Each song has its own directory. Each directory contains the raw guitar recording as a .wav file, the played tabulature and a video showing Digistring synthesizing sound based on the file. In the video, the synthesized audio is played on the left audio channel and the original guitar signal on the right audio channel.
